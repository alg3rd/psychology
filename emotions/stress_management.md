## The Polyvagal Theory
explains how our nervous system regulates our behavior, both collaborative and defensive, using the vagus nerve, the major parasympathetic nerve in the autonomic nervous system. This nerve provides bi-directional connections between the brain and the heart, gut, and other organs in our body, 
and is part of a predictable response sequence that is activated when we are threatened. There are three levels to this response.

Three responses to danger:
- immobilization. Under dire threat, a reptile, mammal, or human may collapse and mimic death. This is a natural and adaptive reaction
- mobilization. Under threat, the heart begins to beat faster. The sympathetic nervous system is activated, the body produces cortisol 
and adrenaline and prepares for action. This is the fight-or-flight response. We become aggressive, or we flee. 
- engagement and connection. When we feel safe again, we begin to function differently. It is at this level that a uniquely mammalian vagal pathway 
becomes functional and quiets the defensive features of both the fight/flight and shutdown pathways. 
The body releases oxytocin. In this state, we are more open to others and experience a sense of connectedness that can lead to collaboration and learning.


Step 1– Understanding: The first step is knowing the biology behind these reactions and accepting that being at level one, two, or three is normal. 
Knowing where you are on the hierarchy gives you choice and the power to shift.

Step 2– Awareness: When you feel challenged, notice the physical and emotional cues that signal you’re experiencing anxiety. 
Do you feel a knot in your stomach? Or your heart racing? See these as signs of where you are in your reaction: likely level two.

Step 3 – Recall: Bring to mind previous experiences where you’ve successfully moved through uncertainty in the past. You might even 
write down what you did to navigate a difficult situation and use your own success to give yourself hope that you can get through this one too.

Step 4 – Intention: With hope in mind, let go of the need to serve your ego by clarifying your highest purpose. Focusing on your 
intention will release oxytocin and help you shift to level three.

Step 5 – Trust the process: When you’re at level three, it’s much easier to explore and develop ideas with the other person. The interaction is an emergent learning process — it will be challenging, but as long as you stay connected and don’t move back to level one or two, you can get through it together.
In fact, you can become skilled at making others safe and keep inviting them back into mutually beneficial conversations.
